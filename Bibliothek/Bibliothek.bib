	abstract = {For many years, the automated construction of school timetables has been subject of research in Artiﬁcial Intelligence and Operations Research. This thesis combines techniques from both areas: Formulations as a constraint satisfaction problem and as a pseudo-boolean optimization problem are each combined with the relaxation of the corresponding linear program, in order to obtain better results more quickly. For each variant and combination of these formulations, tests were carried out using four different instances. The results show that – at least for smaller schools like German primary schools – the proposed methods are as fast as established methods. In contrast to these, the proposed methods always yield entirely feasible and provably optimal solutions. Moreover, they are easier to extend and adjust. When combined with commercial solvers, the proposed problem formulations achieve better results for larger instances like those of German high schools, as well. The formulations and results in this thesis are speciﬁc to the German education system.},

	abstract = {It might be said that there are five basic tree search algorithms for the constraint satisfaction problem (csp), namely, naive backtracking ({BT}), backjumping ({BJ}), conflict-directed backjumping ({CBJ}), backmarking ({BM}), and forward checking ({FC}). In broad terms, {BT}, {BJ}, and {CBJ} describe different styles of backward move (backtracking), whereas {BT}, {BM}, and {FC} describe different styles of forward move (labeling of variables). This paper presents an approach that allows base algorithms to be combined, giving us new hybrids. The base algorithms are described explicitly, in terms of a forward move and a backward move. It is then shown that the forward move of one algorithm may be combined with the backward move of another, giving a new hybrid. In total, four hybrids are presented: backmarking with backjumping ({BMJ}), backmarking with conflict-directed backjumping ({BM}-{CBJ}), forward checking with backjumping ({FC}-{BJ}), and forward checking with conflict-directed backjumping ({FC}-{CBJ}). The performances of the nine algorithms ({BT}, {BJ}, {CBJ}, {BM}, {BMJ}, {BM}-{CBJ}, {FC}, {FC}-{BJ}, {FC}-{CBJ}) are compared empirically, using 450 instances of the {ZEBRA} problem, and it is shown that {FC}-{CBJ} is by far the best of the algorithms examined.},

A number of different approaches have been developed for solving these problems. Some of them use constraint propagation to simplify the original problem. Others use backtracking to directly search for possible solutions. Some are a combination of these two techniques. This article overviews many of these approaches in a tutorial fashion.},

@article{hilbert-siekmann_zur_2001,

	abstract = {This thesis examines the problem of setting timetables at primary and secondary schools, which is defined as the problem of assigning teaching units (combinations of teachers, classes, subjects and room groups) to time slots and rooms. The analysis starts with an identification, based on an empirical survey, of constraints and objectives relevant to this problem also pointing out differences from related timetabling problems. The thesis continues with an analysis of solution approaches which have formerly been developed by practitioners as well as scientists in the timetabling field in order to identify their potential to adequately solve the special problem regarded here. Moreover, three new approaches based on Mixed Integer Programming are presented forming the main focus of the thesis. The first one, {ToMIP}, transforms the problem into a single mixed integer model. The second approach, {HiMIP}, divides the overall problem into one weekly and several daily problems. Each of these problems is depicted in a separate mixed integer model with the solution of the weekly model rendering the basic data for each daily model. The third approach, {SeMIP}, divides the set of all teaching units into a number of subsets using calculated priorities as well as school classes as separation criteria. Each of these subsets is represented by its own mixed integer sub-model. The sub-models are solved sequentially with each model containing the results of its predecessors as side constraints. Approaches {HiMIP} and {SeMIP} also contain randomized components in order to guarantee varying solution paths when the solution process is iterated. Having formulated the three new solution approaches test results based on real life data are presented. They show that {ToMIP} and {HiMIP} have no potential, whereas {SeMIP} has a significant potential of properly setting primary and secondary school timetables.},
