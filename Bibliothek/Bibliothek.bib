	abstract = {The paper motivates, presents, demonstrates in use, and evaluates a methodology for conducting design science (DS) research in information systems. DS is of importance in a discipline oriented to the creation of successful artifacts. Several IS researchers have pioneered DS research in IS, yet over the last 15 years little DS research has been done within the discipline. The lack of a methodology to serve as a commonly accepted framework for DS research and of a template for its presentation may have contributed to its slow adoption. The design science research methodology (DSRM) presented here incorporates principles, practices, and procedures required to carry out such research and meets three objectives: it is consistent with prior literature, it provides a nominal process model for doing DS research, and it provides a mental model for presenting and evaluating DS research in IS. The DS process includes six steps: problem identification and motivation, definition of the objectives for a solution, design and development, demonstration, evaluation, and communication. We demonstrate and evaluate the methodology by presenting four case studies in terms of the DSRM, including cases that present the design of a database to support health assessment methods, a software reuse measure, an Internet video telephony application, and an IS planning method. The designed methodology effectively satisfies the three objectives and has the potential to help aid the acceptance of DS research in the IS discipline.},

It has an utmost relevance because action researchers are working with practitioners to solve the important practical problem. Design science outlined some years ago is just winning a wider audience. Action research was traditionally classified into qualitative research methods. But it seems to be the “wrong” home of action research. We shall show that after comparison of the seven aspects: concrete results of the study, knowledge produced, activities, the intent and the nature of a study, the division of labor in a study and generation, use and test of knowledge, the concordance between the characteristics of action research on the one hand and of design science on the other hand is very good. Hence, action research and design science should next be considered as similar research approaches, and this is a turning point in the history of both action research and design science.},

The conclusions are on the one hand that science and engineering are strongly interwoven and mutually dependent on each other, but on the other hand that there are fundamental differences between scientific research and engineering design. They consequently require specific methodologies.},

This, in turn, means that there are no absolute measures of usability, since, if the usability of an artefact is defined by the context in which that artefact is used, measures of usability must of necessity be defined by that context too. Despite this, there is a need for broad general measures which can be used to compare usability across a range of contexts. In addition, there is a need for “quick and dirty” methods to allow low cost assessments of usability in industrial systems evaluation. This chapter describes the System Usability Scale (SUS) a reliable, low-cost usability scale that can be used for global assessments of systems usability.},

Most subjective measures used in practice are unvalidated, and their relationship to system usage is unknown.

Definitionsfor these two variables were used to develop scale items thatwerepretested forcontent validityand then tested forreliability and construct validityin two studies involving a total of 152 users and four applicationprograms. Themeasures were refinedand streamlined, resultingin two six-itemscales withreliabilities of .98 for usefulness and .94 for ease of use.

In both studies, usefulness had a significantlygreater correlation withusage behaviorthan did ease of use.

It is argued that both theoretical and practical advances in workload assessment have been unnecessarily slowed by a lack of concern for measurement issues. Typical of this impedance are some recently reported “empirical results“ comparing various workload assessment techniques which actually follow directly from some misunderstood statistical properties of the scales. The commonly used subjective workload assessment procedures have distinct psychometric properties that make each procedure sensitive to different kinds of workload measurement. Examination of the properties for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index (NASA TLX) support its potential as a general prediction model for experienced workload and for the Subjective Workload Assessment Technique (SWAT) as a cognitive model sensitive to individual differences.},
