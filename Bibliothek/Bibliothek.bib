	abstract = {Exciting developments in eye-wearable technology and its potential industrial applications warrant a thorough understanding of its advantages and drawbacks through empirical evidence. We conducted an experiment to investigate what characteristics of eye-wearable technology impact user performance in machine maintenance, which included a representative set of car maintenance tasks involving Locate, Manipulate, and Compare actions. Participants were asked to follow instructions displayed on one of four technologies: a peripheral eye-wearable display, a central eye-wearable display, a tablet, or a paper manual. We found a significant effect of display position: the peripheral eye-wearable display resulted in longer completion time than the central display; but no effect for hands-free operation. The technology effects were also modulated by different Tasks and Action types. We discuss the human factors implications for designing more effective eye-wearable technology, including display position, issues of monocular display, and how the physical proximity of the technology affects users' reliance level.},

Effective product realization methods and tools are the answers to these societal expectations. In this paper, a new type of CAE tools, called virtual and augmented reality technologies, is introduced, reviewed and examined to reveal their great potentials in product realization. Specific areas where these emerging technologies can make a big difference are highlighted to illustrate the possible new paradigms of product realization. Subjects that require continuing R\&D efforts to mature the technologies for real-world engineering applications are also identified. Both product development engineers and virtual reality researchers should find this paper valuable to guide their efforts in developing a common road map for joint explorations. It is anticipated that the results from these joint explorations will enable engineers to deliver new products to the society across the time, space and other boundaries with high efficiency and great ease in the future.},

	doi = {10.1109/ISMAR.2007.4538834},
	abstract = {Construction companies employ CAD software during the planning phase, but what is finally built often does not match the original plan. The procedure of validating the model is called "discrepancy check". The system proposed here allows the user to easily obtain an augmentation in order to find differences between the planned 3D model and the built items. The main difference to previous body of work in this field is the emphasis on usability and acceptance of the solution. While standard image-based solutions use markers or rely on a "perfect" 3D model to find the pose of the camera, our software uses anchor-plates. Anchor-Plates are rectangular structures installed on walls and ceiling in the majority of industrial edifices. We are using them as landmarks because they are the most reliable components often used as reference coordinates by constructors. Furthermore, for real industrial applications, they are the most suitable solutions in terms of general applicability. Unfortunately, they have not been designed with computer vision applications in mind. On the contrary, they are often made or painted in such way that they are not easily popping out. They are therefore difficult targets to segment and to track. This paper proposes a solution to extract and match them to their 3D counterparts. We created a software that uses the detected structures for pose estimation and image augmentation. The software has been successfully employed to find discrepancies in several rooms of two industrial plants.},

	abstract = "Adoption of innovations within small and middle-sized enterprises (SMEs) employing fewer than 250 employees is limited compared to large companies. Within the current study, our goal is to identify hindering factors influencing adoption of innovation within SMEs. To identify this, we conducted a case study on the usage of mobility related innovations within 20 small and medium-sized enterprises. We found six crucial factors hindering SMEs of adoption of innovations: perceived unbalance of risks and chances, compatibility with daily work routine, lacking fit in individual business processes, complexity in infrastructure investments, IT know how and amount of costs for setup. Our study contributes to an extended understanding of the theory of adoption of innovations. Based on the identification of these factors, the study provides practical implications for SMEs to integrate innovations into current business processes. The results foster the adoption of innovation within SMEs."

Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) play a key role in innovative contribution and growth of the global economy, yet face unique challenges with regard to new product development. To date scholars disagree on the effect of firm size on the antecedents and outcomes for innovation speed. We review the relevant literature, develop a conceptual model of innovation speed for SMEs and test it with 158 projects across several technology-related industries. Results revealed that SMEs had different speed antecedents from large firms, had their antecedents vary by radicalness and found speed to be synergistic with efficiency, quality and project success. Implications for managers and scholars are discussed.},

However, there has been little theoretical advancement or model building regarding when innovation speed is appropriate, what factors speed up innovations, and how differences in speed affect project outcomes. In this article, we organize and integrate the innovation speed literature, develop a conceptual framework of innovation speed, and offer researchable propositions relating to the need for and antecedents and outcomes of innovation speed. Specifically, we argue that innovation speed (a) is most appropriate in environments characterized by competitive intensity, technological and market dynamism, and low regulatory restrictiveness; (b) can be positively or negatively affected by strategic-orientation factors and organizational-capability factors; and (c) has an influence on development costs, product quality, and ultimately project success.},

	abstract = {This study empirically investigates a wide array of factors that have been argued to differentiate fast from slow innovation processes from the perspective of the research and development organization. We test the effects of strategic orientation (criteria- and scope-related variables) and organizational capability (staffing- and structuring-related variables) on the speed of 75 new product development projects from ten large firms in several industries. Backward-elimination regression analysis revealed that (a) clear time-goals, longer tenure among team members, and parallel development increased speed, whereas (b) design for manufacturability, frequent product testing, and computer-aided design systems decreased speed. However, when projects were sorted by magnitude of change, different factors were found to influence the speed of radical and incremental projects. Moreover, some factors that sped up radical innovation (e.g., concept clarity, champion presence, co-location) were found to slow down incremental innovation. Together, the radical and incremental models explain differences in speed better than the general model. This suggests a contingency approach to speeding up innovation. Implications for researchers and managers are discussed.},

Commercial 4D CAD applications are becoming more accessible and the use of this technology allows the construction planner to produce more rigorous schedules. A review of the technical competencies of these packages highlights that most of the commercially available packages concentrate on the use of 4D CAD simulations for aesthetic visualization purposes. Very few packages offer the ability to carry out analytical tasks on the developed simulation and this is often left to the interpretation of the user. A thorough appraisal of emerging research developments in 4D planning highlights that this technology is employed for various applications; however, the amount of detail required in a 4D simulation is still ambiguous. A model is proposed to determine the attributes required for use with each of the various applications of 4D CAD simulations. Finally, various lines of future research are highlighted, including the need for improved use of data exchange standards and the automation of linking the construction tasks to the 3D CAD model.},

	abstract = {The paper motivates, presents, demonstrates in use, and evaluates a methodology for conducting design science (DS) research in information systems. DS is of importance in a discipline oriented to the creation of successful artifacts. Several IS researchers have pioneered DS research in IS, yet over the last 15 years little DS research has been done within the discipline. The lack of a methodology to serve as a commonly accepted framework for DS research and of a template for its presentation may have contributed to its slow adoption. The design science research methodology (DSRM) presented here incorporates principles, practices, and procedures required to carry out such research and meets three objectives: it is consistent with prior literature, it provides a nominal process model for doing DS research, and it provides a mental model for presenting and evaluating DS research in IS. The DS process includes six steps: problem identification and motivation, definition of the objectives for a solution, design and development, demonstration, evaluation, and communication. We demonstrate and evaluate the methodology by presenting four case studies in terms of the DSRM, including cases that present the design of a database to support health assessment methods, a software reuse measure, an Internet video telephony application, and an IS planning method. The designed methodology effectively satisfies the three objectives and has the potential to help aid the acceptance of DS research in the IS discipline.},

It has an utmost relevance because action researchers are working with practitioners to solve the important practical problem. Design science outlined some years ago is just winning a wider audience. Action research was traditionally classified into qualitative research methods. But it seems to be the “wrong” home of action research. We shall show that after comparison of the seven aspects: concrete results of the study, knowledge produced, activities, the intent and the nature of a study, the division of labor in a study and generation, use and test of knowledge, the concordance between the characteristics of action research on the one hand and of design science on the other hand is very good. Hence, action research and design science should next be considered as similar research approaches, and this is a turning point in the history of both action research and design science.},

The conclusions are on the one hand that science and engineering are strongly interwoven and mutually dependent on each other, but on the other hand that there are fundamental differences between scientific research and engineering design. They consequently require specific methodologies.},

This, in turn, means that there are no absolute measures of usability, since, if the usability of an artefact is defined by the context in which that artefact is used, measures of usability must of necessity be defined by that context too. Despite this, there is a need for broad general measures which can be used to compare usability across a range of contexts. In addition, there is a need for “quick and dirty” methods to allow low cost assessments of usability in industrial systems evaluation. This chapter describes the System Usability Scale (SUS) a reliable, low-cost usability scale that can be used for global assessments of systems usability.},

Most subjective measures used in practice are unvalidated, and their relationship to system usage is unknown.

Definitionsfor these two variables were used to develop scale items thatwerepretested forcontent validityand then tested forreliability and construct validityin two studies involving a total of 152 users and four applicationprograms. Themeasures were refinedand streamlined, resultingin two six-itemscales withreliabilities of .98 for usefulness and .94 for ease of use.

In both studies, usefulness had a significantlygreater correlation withusage behaviorthan did ease of use.

It is argued that both theoretical and practical advances in workload assessment have been unnecessarily slowed by a lack of concern for measurement issues. Typical of this impedance are some recently reported “empirical results“ comparing various workload assessment techniques which actually follow directly from some misunderstood statistical properties of the scales. The commonly used subjective workload assessment procedures have distinct psychometric properties that make each procedure sensitive to different kinds of workload measurement. Examination of the properties for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index (NASA TLX) support its potential as a general prediction model for experienced workload and for the Subjective Workload Assessment Technique (SWAT) as a cognitive model sensitive to individual differences.},
